# TerrraNetwork
Limited information is available at this point.

## Purpose
The TerrraNetwork serves as a communication infrastructure between clients and the Roblox platform.

## System Architecture
This system utilizes the C++ programming language for both the client and server components. The Roblox platform employs the Luau scripting language on its side due to platform-specific constraints.

## Functional Scope
TerraNetwork equips users with the ability to exercise direct control and execute commands seamlessly across interconnected servers.

## Clear Clarification
It's crucial to reiterate that while TerraNetwork might share certain traits with backdoor access, its primary function revolves around streamlining server management responsibilities. Any implications of malicious intent are unfounded, as TerraNetwork's sole purpose remains centered on legitimate server management facilitation.

## Open Source
TerraNetwork is made open source to encourage collaboration and innovation within the development community. By sharing its source code, developers from various backgrounds can contribute their expertise and ideas, ultimately leading to improvements and new features. This open approach fosters transparency, allowing anyone to inspect the code and ensure its reliability and security. Moreover, open sourcing TerraNetwork promotes a sense of community, enabling developers to learn from each other's work and collectively build a robust communication system that benefits a wider audience.

We look forward to recieve your pull requests to enhance TerraNetwork's code. Your contributions would be greatly appreciated and can help improve the system for everyone. Thank you for considering this opportunity to collaborate and make a positive impact.
